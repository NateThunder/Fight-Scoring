Fight Scoring on Ethereum

A modular set of Solidity contracts for registering fighters and judges, creating matches, submitting round scores, and deriving winners by judge consensus. Built for local development with Hardhat and quick testing in Remix.

Why this exists

Judging in combat sports can be opaque. This project explores an on-chain scoring flow that is transparent, auditable, and extendable. You can plug in better data sources later without rewriting the core logic.

Contracts
	•	FighterReg.sol register fighters and query them
	•	JudgeReg.sol register and manage judges
	•	MatchReg.sol create matches and link fighters and judges
	•	Scoring.sol judges submit round scores per match
	•	JudgeConsensus.sol compute winner by majority based on totals
	•	JudgeRankPayout.sol track judge alignment and enable incentives

These map to the structure already in the repo.  ￼

Project layout

contracts/            Core Solidity contracts
test/                 TypeScript tests (Hardhat + chai)
scripts/              Optional helpers for deployment/interactions
ignition/modules/     Hardhat Ignition deployment modules
fight-ui/             Simple demo UI
typechain-types/      Autogenerated types
hardhat.config.ts     Hardhat config

Prerequisites
	•	Node 18+
	•	npm or pnpm
	•	A local Hardhat network or an RPC endpoint if you want to deploy
	•	Optional: MetaMask and Remix for quick poking

Quick start

Clone and install:

git clone https://github.com/NateThunder/Fight-Scoring
cd Fight-Scoring
npm install

Compile:

npx hardhat compile

Run tests:

npx hardhat test

You should see tests around the scoring and consensus logic, like CombatScoring.test.ts.

Local deployment

Start a local node:

npx hardhat node

In another terminal, deploy with Hardhat Ignition:

npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules --network localhost

If you prefer a classic script-based deploy, add a script under scripts/ and run:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost

Network names depend on your hardhat.config.ts.

Environment variables

If you deploy to a real network, create a .env:

RPC_URL=<your_rpc>
PRIVATE_KEY=<your_wallet_private_key>
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<optional_for_verification>

Then reference them in hardhat.config.ts.

Interacting with contracts

Example with ethers v6:

import { ethers } from "hardhat";

async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

  const FighterReg = await ethers.getContractFactory("FighterReg");
  const fighterReg = await FighterReg.deploy();
  await fighterReg.waitForDeployment();

  const fighterId = await fighterReg.registerFighter(
    deployer.address,
    "Fighter Zero"
  );

  console.log("FighterReg:", await fighterReg.getAddress(), "ID:", fighterId);
}

main().catch((e) => {
  console.error(e);
  process.exit(1);
});

Using Remix
	1.	Open Remix.
	2.	Upload the .sol files from contracts/.
	3.	Compile with the pragma version shown in each file.
	4.	Deploy FighterReg, JudgeReg, MatchReg, Scoring, JudgeConsensus, and JudgeRankPayout.
	5.	Use the UI to submit scores and query results.

Data model and flow
	•	Register fighters in FighterReg
	•	Register judges in JudgeReg
	•	Create a match in MatchReg with fighters and judges
	•	Judges call Scoring to submit round scores
	•	JudgeConsensus aggregates totals and returns the majority winner
	•	JudgeRankPayout can update judge rankings and handle payouts based on alignment

You can replace the local registries with an oracle later if you want real fight metadata.

Roadmap
	•	Majority winner view helper
	•	Win percentage and judge alignment scoring
	•	Incentive payout for accurate judges
	•	Dynamic fighter ranking (Elo style or win based)
	•	Oracle integration for fighter and match data

Security notes
	•	This is research software. Do not use in production without audits.
	•	Add guards for duplicate scoring, reentrancy, and role management where needed.
	•	Write invariants and fuzz tests around the scoring math.
